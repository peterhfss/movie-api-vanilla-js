### Day 01

On the first day of this challenge, I created a static website with static data using only HTML and CSS. In CSS I used concepts of Flexbox to create the layout of the project and position the elements.

### Day 02

On the second day of the challenge, I added a script containing JavaScript code for DOM to have dynamism to show the list of movies. To display in the same way as day one, I created a array  with all information about the movies. Using forEach, was possible to call a function to receive a variable movie,and create an element on DOM.
